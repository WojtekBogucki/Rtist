# Examples of usage

You can use this package just by

```{r}
library(Rtist)
```

As defualt bg_color is set `"gold"`, so when we do not input any values we receive a beautiful river surrounded by golden sand.

```{r}
Rzeka()
```

When we want another color we just set `bg_color`, i.e. `'orange'`:

```{r}
Rzeka(bg_color = "orange")
```

Event when you set `bg_color` to `'puprple'` it works and even adjusts to given color in some kind of funny way:

```{r}
Rzeka(bg_color = "purple")
```
